# ShoppingCartandCheckoutArea
This PHP project is the final project for my course.  It is designed to be a shopping cart-type program with a checkout area for an online bookstore.

Here are the specs for the project:

Your goal here is to create a shopping cart complete with products, prices, registration, and a checkout area. 

Try to incorporate as many elements from the course as you can. For instance, you might want to use arrays for products, functions for various program tasks, template files, form validation, cookies/sessions for cart persistence and confirmation/receipt emails. You are mightily encouraged to observe good programming practices, with comments, as well as code reusability and readability. 

You may hand in a minimum of five files. Please make sure to tell your mentor which file begins your project.

Be creative and have fun! Present yourself in a professional, yet friendly way. Feel free to express yourself!
